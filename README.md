# Flappy Bird AI – Neuro-Evolution

This project implements a neural network trained using **genetic algorithms** (Neuro-Evolution) to play the Flappy Bird game.

## Project Highlights

- Utilizes **Neuro-Evolution** to evolve the weights of the neural network.
- The AI **learns without supervision**, improving over generations by selecting the fittest birds.
- Demonstrates **reinforcement-like behavior** through genetic selection.
- Capable of playing the game **as well as an expert human player**.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- NumPy

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1010Vishwajeet/Flappy_Bird_AI.git
cd Flappy_Bird_AI
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python flappy.py
```

The AI will begin training and improving its performance over generations.
